# HNG Internship Projects

This repository houses projects and exercises for the HNG Internship program. Each "Stage" of the program (Stage 0, Stage 1, ...) has its own subdirectory containing the specific tasks, code, and a detailed README describing that stage.

## Repository purpose

- Serve as a single workspace for all HNG program artifacts and projects.
- Provide a simple, consistent structure so participants and reviewers can find stage-specific work quickly.
- Include centralized guidance for contribution, running tests, and repository-wide conventions.
