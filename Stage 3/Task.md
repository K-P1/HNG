# 🧠 Stage 3 Backend Task – Build and Integrate AI Agents

## 🎯 Objective

Build an **AI agent** that performs a useful task, connects to **Telex.im**, and interacts intelligently with users.

---

## 🚀 Getting Access

Run this command to join the Telex organization:
```

/telex-invite [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com)

````
(Replace with your actual email.)

## 🧩 What to Build
Create an AI agent that:
- Solves a problem or automates something useful.
- Responds to users and performs intelligent actions on Telex.im.

**Examples:**
- A code helper for developers
- A task tracker or reminder bot
- A summarization or automation bot

  ## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

  ### For TypeScript / JavaScript Developers

  - You **must use Mastra**
  - Tasks:
    - Set up a Mastra agent
    - Define its behavior
    - Connect it to Telex.im using the **A2A protocol** (JSON formatted)
  - Use any positive integers for node positions in workflow JSON:

  ```json
  "position": [816, -112]
  ```

  ### For Other Languages (Python, Go, Rust, C#, PHP, etc.)

  - Build your agent from scratch
  - Tasks:
    - Write core logic
    - Handle incoming messages
    - Create endpoints compatible with Telex.im

  ---

  ## 🌐 Integration Requirements

  Your agent must:
  - Respond to Telex.im messages or events
  - Send valid responses or actions
  - Use REST or WebSocket (keep it simple)
  - Handle errors gracefully and validate outputs

  You must provide:
  - A **public endpoint** or **GitHub repo** for testing

  ---

  ## 📦 Deliverables

  - ✅ Working AI agent
  - ✅ Full Telex.im integration
  - ✅ Live demo or API endpoint
  - ✅ Documentation (what it does + how to run it)
  - ✅ Blog post explaining your process
  - ✅ Tweet showcasing your agent

  **Tagging:**
  - JS/TS devs → `@mastra`
  - Other languages → `@hnginternship` and `@teleximapp`

  ## 🧾 Evaluation Criteria

  - Functionality and intelligence of the agent
  - Integration quality with Telex.im
  - Code structure and documentation
  - Creativity and originality
  - Error handling and testing quality
  - Clarity and quality of your blog post

  ---

  ## 📤 Submission

  - You can use **any language** (even Fortran, C, or Assembly)
  - Submit via:

  ```bash
  /submit
  ```

  in the `#stage-3-backend` channel.
